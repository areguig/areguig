# Hi, I'm Akli 👋 

### Software Engineer & Freelance Consultant based in Paris 🇫🇷

I specialize in building scalable, maintainable back-end systems within the **JVM Ecosystem**. With over a decade of experience, I help companies bridge the gap between complex business requirements and robust technical implementations.

### 🚀 What I'm currently focusing on:
- **Architecture:** Crafting cloud-native microservices with Spring Boot.
- **Developer Experience:** Building tools that make testing and deployment seamless.
- **Data Engineering:** Optimizing PostgreSQL performance and complex data modeling.
- **AI-Augmented Development:** Leveraging LLMs and agentic tools to streamline my workflow, automate the "boring stuff," and focus on high-level architectural problem-solving.
